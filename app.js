// Root file
// Server file of node app
// Server will run from here

// Const as we will use it but will never redefined it
const http = require('http');

// Request listener receives 2 arguments
// 1. request of type "IncomingMessage"
// 2. response of type "ServerResponse"
// Node.js automatically gives us the incoming request as an object and response which we can use to send a response to whoever sent that request


// http.createServer return a Server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log(req.url, req.method, req.headers);
});

// Server has a bunch of methods to call, one of them is listen
// Listen starts a process when nodejs not immediately exit our script, but nodejs keeps it running to listen to incoming requests
// Listen takes optional arguments
// 1. port on which server will listen (On prod, we will typically not fill this out and it will take a default of 80), on dev, will give it a "number"
// 2. Hostname: string, by default it will be the name of machine it is running on , on local machine it is "localhost"
// Thousand ports are pretty safe
// It will have ongoing looping process that keeps the app running
// You can hit localhost:3000 on browser to check the request logged on to console
server.listen(3000);
